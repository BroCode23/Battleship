# Battleship
Working Text-based Battleship game

# Usage
1. Run Battleship.py in the terminal using your python interpreter
2. The placing of boats uses "space from top" and "space from left". This basically means the amount of pegs between the boat and the end of the board.
3. Shooting in a specific location works as normal, use x and y coordinates to tell the program where to shoot.
4. The game ends when either the computer or the player sink all of the opposing player's ships.

# Features
